_Orders Excel file_

This robot will process [web store](https://www.saucedemo.com/) orders based on the given input Excel file.

The robot uses provided credentials for logging into the store. The credentials are considered sensitive information. The credentials are stored in _environment variables_ in order to not expose them in the code repository.

> Never commit sensitive information in your project. Provide the credentials for your robot from environment variables or with some other mechanism where the credentials are not exposed.

To provide the web store orders for the robot from the Excel file, you are going to implement an order processing library using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.

To make setting up and running your robot easier, you are also going to provide some _scripts_ to ease the setup and execution. These scripts handle the installation of required libraries and drivers and provide an easy way to run the robot.

When run, the robot will:

- open a real web browser and load the web store login page
- log into the web store using credentials provided using environment variables
- collect the orders from the provided Excel file using a custom Python library
- loop through the orders and complete the checkout for each order
- write log and report files
- close the browser on process completion

## Prerequisites

> To complete this tutorial, you need to have [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed. You also need a working [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3) installation. On macOS / Linux, you can open the terminal and try running `python3 --version` to check if you have the required Python installed. On Windows, you can open the command prompt and try running `py --version` to check if you have the required Python installed.

You will start by creating some setup files and scripts to aid with setting up and executing your robot. The scripts will also help other people who want to use your robot to get everything up and running easily.

## Project directory

Create a new `swag-order-robot` directory. This directory will contain the robot script and other required resources.

## Requirements file

You are going to use several libraries when implementing your robot. To make installing them easier, you are going to provide the list of required libraries in a text file. [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) can read this file and handle the installation for you.

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a file by name `requirements.txt`. Paste the following libraries in the file:

```
pandas
robotframework
robotframework-seleniumlibrary
webdrivermanager
xlrd
```

## Installation script: macOS / Linux

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a new `scripts` directory. This directory will contain the scripts for setting up and running your robot.

In the `scripts` directory, create a file by name `prepare.sh`. Paste the following _shell script_ in the `prepare.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then
    export browser=chrome
else
    export browser=$1
fi

python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade wheel pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt

webdrivermanager $browser
```

Save the shell script.

Make sure the shell script has _execution permissions_ by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod u+x prepare.sh
```

Your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
swag-order-robot
├── requirements.txt
└── scripts
    └── prepare.sh
```

Navigate to the `swag-order-robot` directory.

Execute the installation script to setup required libraries and drivers by running the following command:

```bash
./scripts/prepare.sh
```

The example output should look similar to this (cropped):

```bash
$ ./scripts/prepare.sh

```

## Run script: macOS / Linux

To make running your robot easier, you are going to create a shell script for that purpose.

Inside the `scripts` directory, create a file by name `run.sh` and paste in the following shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

. venv/bin/activate

python -m robot -d output -P libraries -P resources -P variables --logtitle "Task log" tasks/

```

Make sure the shell script has execution permissions by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod u+x run.sh
```

## Installation script: Windows

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a new `scripts` directory. This directory will contain the scripts for setting up and running your robot.

In the `scripts` directory, create a file by name `prepare.bat`. Paste the following _Windows batch script_ in the `prepare.bat` file:

```batch
py -m venv venv
call venv\Scripts\activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
webdrivermanager chrome

call venv\Scripts\deactivate

```

Save the batch script.

Your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
swag-order-robot
├── requirements.txt
└── scripts
    └── prepare.bat
```

Navigate to the `swag-order-robot` directory.

Execute the installation script to setup required libraries and drivers by running the following command:

```
scripts\prepare.bat
```

## Run script: Windows

To make running your robot easier, you are going to create a Windows batch script for that purpose.

Inside the `scripts` directory, create a file by name `run.bat` and paste in the following Windows batch script:

```batch
call venv\Scripts\activate

python -m robot -d output -P libraries -P resources -P variables --logtitle "Task log" tasks/

call venv\Scripts\deactivate

```

## Robot script

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a directory by name `tasks`.

Inside the `tasks` directory, create a file by name `swag-order-robot.robot`.

Paste the following Robot Framework code in the `swag-order-robot.robot` file:

```robot
*** Settings ***

```

## Variables file

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a directory by name `variables`.

Inside the `variables` directory, create a file by name `variables.py`.

Paste the following Python code in the `variables.py` file:

```py
import os

EXCEL_FILE_PATH = "./data/Data.xlsx"
SWAG_LABS_URL = "https://www.saucedemo.com"
SWAG_LABS_PASSWORD = os.getenv("SWAG_LABS_PASSWORD")
SWAG_LABS_USER_NAME = os.getenv("SWAG_LABS_USER_NAME")
```

## Order processing library

In order to read in an Excel file and to transform the Excel data to orders for the robot, you are going to implement a custom order collecting library using Python and `pandas` library.

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a directory by name `libraries`.

Inside the `libraries` directory, create a file by name `Orders.py` and paste in the following code:

```py
import pandas


class Orders:
    def get_orders(self, excel):
        data_frame = pandas.read_excel(excel)
        orders = []
        for row in data_frame.values:
            order = {
                "item": row[1],
                "zip": row[2],
                "first_name": row[0].split()[0],
                "last_name": row[0].split()[1]
            }
            orders.append(order)
        return orders
```

## Excel file

The order information is stored in an Excel file (`Data.xlsx`). The file is formatted as follows:

| Name               | Item                              | Zip  |

| Brandan Dillon     | Sauce Labs Bolt T-Shirt           | 3218 |

Inside the `swag-order-robot` directory, create a directory by name `data`.

[Download the Excel file](https://github.com/janipalsamaki/swag-order-robot/raw/master/data/Data.xlsx) and save it in the `data` directory.

## Credential environment variables

The robot reads the credentials from the environment variables. On macOS Catalina, when using `zsh`, you can define the environment variables in `~/.zshrc` file. The `~` means your _home folder_.

> Create the `.zshrc` in your home folder if it does not exist. You can navigate to your home folder by running `cd` command in the terminal.

In the `.zshrc` file (or similar, if using `bash`), add the environment variables:

```bash
# Swag Labs credentials
export SWAG_LABS_PASSWORD=secret_sauce
export SWAG_LABS_USER_NAME=standard_user
```

> You may need to open up a new terminal to load the environment variables. Another way is to run `source ~/.zshrc` after editing the `.zshrc` file. You can run `env` command to verify that the environment variables have been set successfully.

If you are using Windows, you can follow these [instructions on setting environment variables in Windows 10](https://www.techjunkie.com/environment-variables-windows-10/).

## Running the robot

Your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
swag-order-robot
├── data
│   └── Data.xlsx
├── libraries
│   └── Orders.py
├── requirements.txt
├── resources
│   └── keywords.robot
├── scripts
│   ├── prepare.sh (or prepare.bat)
│   └── run.sh (or run.bat)
├── tasks
│   └── swag-order-robot.robot
└── variables
    └── variables.py

```

In the terminal, navigate to the `swag-order-robot` directory and execute (run) the robot:

macOS / Linux:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

Windows:

```
scripts\run.bat
```

The example output might look something like the following:

```bash
==============================================================================
Swag-Order-Robot :: Swag order robot. Places orders at https://www.saucedem...
==============================================================================
Place orders                                                          | PASS |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swag-Order-Robot :: Swag order robot. Places orders at https://www... | PASS |

Log:     /your-projects-directory/swag-order-robot/output/log.html
Report:  /your-projects-directory/swag-order-robot/output/report.html
```

> The robot will complain if the credential environment variables or the Excel file do not exist.
